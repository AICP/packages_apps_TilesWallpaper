Android Live Wallpaper in Java using OpenGL ES 3.0

First Try doing a little bit more complex Android App kind of thing.

All you can see here is work in progress, for stable Version go to Google Play
(Free Beta App: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pit.opengles).
If you want to build it for yourself, you can do so, just install Android Studio, build APK, copy to your phone(Minimum API 21(Android 5.0)), enjoy :)

Feature wishes are welcome.

Big shoutout to the guys from http://www.learnopengles.com for the good explanations to the different OpenGL ES topics; learned a lot from them!
